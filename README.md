python-thesaurus-app
====================

A simple python program that finds all possible variations for a given sentence using an online thesaurus.
Press "e" or type "enter" and press the enter key. This allows you to set the sentence. Once it has been set, the program will fetch all possible variations.
Once it has done the processing, it will report the number of sentences generated and the longest variation.
Now, you can print all at once by pressing "p" and hitting enter, or pressing "r" to print out a random result.

NOTE: you will need an api key from http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php. 
Once you've gotten the key, place it in a file named api_key.py. All you need to put in the file is this one line:
key = "<paste your key here>"
